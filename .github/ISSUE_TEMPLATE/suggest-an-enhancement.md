<!-- Thanks for suggesting an enhancement! -->

## Suggestion

From a fresh installation and clean workspace:

* <steps to...>
* <...setup environment>

I reach state <STATE_DESCRIPTION, eg open a dialog> with

* <steps to...>
* <... reach initial state>

And would like to be able to <FEATURE_DESCRIPTION>.

## Community

- [ ] I understand suggesting an enhancement doesn't mandate anyone to implement it. Other contributors may consider this suggestion, or not, at their own convenience. The most efficient way to get it fixed is that I implement it myself and contribute it back as a good quality patch to the project.
